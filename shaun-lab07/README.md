Usage

Our program automatically creates three converted images for you, which are written into the assets file.

Save a 32-bitmap image to the assets folder, with the name palette-bitmap.bmp - this is the image you want to convert.
With Node.js installed, run in terminal:
node index.js

Converted images (greyscale, blackout, and inverted colors) are written to /assets. Enjoy!
Our Process

We spent the first day of this project pseudo-coding our way to a solution. Once we had a solid direction in mind, we mob-programmed together for several hours to get a rough idea of how the program would take shape. On day 2, we had a rudimentary working draft and were able to work more in detail on our tranform.js file to get our methods to work and write images. Once that was up and working, we DID SOMETHING OR OTHER

While we would have liked to apply the TDD process on this project, we did not use it due to time constraints.
